2022 was a great year for music. With billions of songs streamed over 
<br>
the course of the past 12 months, music fans  discovered plenty of new 
<br>
artists and rekindled their love for old favorites. Of course, some albums 
<br>
stood out more than others, with a handful of artists earning a billion 
<br>
streams on just one singlealone. Spotify took a look at the numbers 
<br>
and calculated just which albums were the most popular and
<br>
the top five will probably come as no surprise!
<br>

<br>
Bad Bunny sat at the top of the charts this year  
<br>
and his massively successful album "Un Verano Sin Ti"
<br>
earned its place as the most streamed album of 
<br>
 the year. The Puerto Rican artist was also
 <br>
named the most streamed artist of the year
<br>
 for a record-breaking third year in a row. 
<br>
On top of that, his songs "Me Porto Bonito" 
<br>
and "Tití Me Preguntó" were both a part of the
<br>
top 5 most streamed songs of the year. <br>
<br>

Harry Styles' sophomore album "Harry's House" earned him
<br>
 the second spot on the top most streamed albums on Spotify. 
<br>
The entire album was streamed over 3 billion times -- partially
<br>
thanks to his song "As It Was," which was streamed 1.6 billion 
<br>
times alone, making it the most streamed song of the year.
<br>
Following all of his success, Harry penned a heartfelt note to
<br>
fans, reflecting on the past year. "2022 changed my life. I can't
<br>
begin to thank all of you who supported me through it, I'll never forget it.
<br>
I hope your end of year is filled with happiness and calm.
<br>
 Love you all," Harry wrote on Instagram. <br>

Ed Sheeran may have released "=" in 2021, but it continued to be streamed
<br>

<br>
the fourth most listened to album of the year. Ed also became the first artist
<br>

<br>
shared the news to celebrate the milestone. <br>
